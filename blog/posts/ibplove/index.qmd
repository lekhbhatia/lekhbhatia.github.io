Analysis is a vast field, and there is a great deal I can say about why I find it beautiful[^1]. However, a common adage conveys the beauty quite concisely: analysis is not about objects, it is about actions. The subjects of interest are not all-encompassing theorems about the macroscopic structure of the field, but rather the usage of ingenious tools to analyze a class of objects. I can find countless examples in harmonic, functional, stochastic, geometric, or microlocal analysis.

Integration by parts is one such ingenious tool which most students will learn in high school, and yet it evades the interest of most undergraduate mathematics students. In this article I will hopefully convince you that it should be of great interest. I love it, and you should too. I break apart this discussion broadly into two focuses: practice and theory.

### Practice

Let us say that I have some function $f \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R})$ which is smooth and compactly supported. Of course, some of these arguments can be modified for a weaker class of $f$, but I don't want to get into the weeds here. Simply speaking, all I require from $f$ is that it is integrable and that

$$
\frac{\mathrm d^n f}{\mathrm d x^n} < \infty
$$

for all $n \in \mathbb N$ up to some sufficiently high amount of regularity. If $f$ is smooth, this is indeed all $n$. We will try to prove a version of the [Riemannâ€“Lebesgue lL;Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann%E2%80%93Lebesgue_lemma) for this $f$.
