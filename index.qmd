I am currently a mathematics honors student at the [MSI](https://maths.anu.edu.au/), working with [Ben Andrews](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/) and [Mat Langford](https://suppiluliuma.neocities.org/). I study curve shortening flow with boundary conditions. However, I am broadly interested in analysis, due to some great lecturers ([Pierre Portal](https://sites.google.com/view/pierre-portal/home), [Po Lam Yung](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~plyung/), [Andrew Hassell](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~hassell/)). I will soon be working for an options market maker as a trader. This website has stuff I do.
