I am currently a mathematics honors student at the [MSI](https://maths.anu.edu.au/), working with [Ben Andrews](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~andrews/) and [Mat Langford](https://suppiluliuma.neocities.org/). I study curve shortening flow with boundary conditions. I will soon be working for an options market maker as a trader. This website has stuff I do.
